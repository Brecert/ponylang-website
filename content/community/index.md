## Getting Started

The most important community resources for those who are new to Pony are:

* #ponylang, our IRC channel on [freenode](https://freenode.net)
* The [Users Mailing List](https://pony.groups.io/g/user) for discussion of all things Pony that don't involve the development of Pony itself

If you are looking for help with Pony and can't get a response in #ponylang, we advise that you send an email to the Users Mailing List.
