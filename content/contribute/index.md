Interested in helping develop Pony? Awesome. We could use the help. Here's a list of projects that are currently underway that you can assist with. If none of them interest you, drop a note to the [pony+dev mailing list](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev) and we should be able to find something that suits your interests.

Note sure where to start?

If you are new to Pony or don't have a ton of time to devout to helping, we suggest you check out Project Documentation and helping to improve our docs.

If you are new to Pony and have more time to devote, check out the Low Hanging Fruit. Tackle stuff from that and if we run out, switch over to helping with documentation.

### Project Documentation

Documentation is the life blood of an Open Source project. It makes it easier for get new users up and running with the language. Our ability to grow Pony usage will be directly tied to the quality and breadth of our documentation. Assisting with adding documentation for Pony is a great way to get started helping out with Pony. Check out [Project Documentation](project-documentation).

### Low Hanging Fruit

When issues come in to the ponyc GitHub project, as part of our initial triaging of issues, some get marked as easy. The general idea behind the easy label to make it simple for people who want to contribute to Pony but don't have much time or knowledge about Pony to be able to contribute. Low hanging fruit issues such as these are a great way to get started with contributing and start learning more about Pony. Check out the [Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22difficulty%3A+1+-+easy%22).
