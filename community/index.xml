      <description>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy, we have a small set of social rules we follow.</description>

      <description>Code of Conduct We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic. Our code of conduct sets the standards for behavior in all official Pony forums.
Getting Started The most important community resources for those who are new to Pony are:
 #ponylang, our IRC channel on freenode The Users Mailing List for discussion of all things Pony that don&amp;rsquo;t involve the development of Pony itself  If you are looking for help with Pony and can&amp;rsquo;t get a response in #ponylang, we advise that you send an email to the Users Mailing List.</description>
